# The-Perfect-Guess Program in PYTHON
If the player's guess is higher than the actual number , the program displays "Lower number please" 
Similarly if the user's guess is too low , the program displays "Higher number please"
When the user guesses the correct number , the program displays the number of guesses the player used to arrive at the number
